    <!-- the defer keyword is used as an attribute in the <script> tag in HTML to control the execution timing of an external JavaScript file. When the defer attribute is added to a script tag, it tells the browser to download the JavaScript file asynchronously (without blocking the HTML parsing), and then execute it only after the HTML document has been fully parsed.-->
